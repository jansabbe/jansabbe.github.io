![Jan Sabbe](/public/images/Jan-Sabbe.jpg)

I am a full-stack developer at [Cegeka](http://www.cegeka.com), a consultancy company providing various solutions to a whole range of clients. I work in all sorts of technologies such as .NET, Java, Swift, JavaScript and the occasional Python. I tend to work as a lead developer, coaching and mentoring members of my team.
